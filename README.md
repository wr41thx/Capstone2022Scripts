C# scripts for Unity Project Capstone 2022

Team Members:
Theodor Melsheimer - War Room, Death Room, Interaction, Player Scripts
Matt Sanders - Famine Room, ScriptableObject Scripts
Guillermo Haro - Pestilence Room

Here is a collection of all the scripts written so far for our Capstone Project as well
as a few screen shots of our repo changesets and the plasticSCM repo itself.

Folders are divided into sections for each room, or for central game mechanics such as Player Scripts
and Interaction Scripts.

Not Included 
- First Person Controller script as it was a Unity Asset for basic player movement and camera control.
(though very slight modifications were made to it)
